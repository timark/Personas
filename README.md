# Personas
## Persona Examples
The persona project contains examples of peronas based on a microsoft word template which was orginally a CV template.
The avatars are created using [Hexatar](http://www.hexatar.com/) 

## What is a persona? 
It is a fictional character normally used to descibe the end user of an application or service. It helps gives focus to the design of an application. A good explaniation can be found here on [interaction design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them)

Personas should be designed from research and this can be from a variety methods or all observation, experience and desktop research.
I use social media sites like [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs) profiles and job vaccancies. If people reference a blog then read that as profiles and experience are sometimes talked up. This provides a data driven justification and needs to be recorded so that if the persona's attributes are challanged then it can be rebutted by sources. 

For example if the persona is a young Architect who has an interest in healthcare, is a keen outdoors mountain biker then a source of experience where the architectural practice has healthcare projects and blog about biking holidays or videos of coming down tracks with tracking data backs up this assumption. They are into outdoor fittness and uses technology to track their own health through performance records. 

## Schema development

The following sources are being used to develop the persona.schema 
[shema.org](https:schema.org) this is data store was developed as part of the semantic web and is an RDF intended use by products and retailing. 

[schemastore](http://schemastore.org/json/) is a data store of schemas in json-schema
